# NikonZ63 Disassembling
A program that you can disassemble your camera by your gesture

# 📸 Nikon Z6 III Interactive Disassembly Viewer

An interactive web-based showcase allowing users to explore the disassembly process of the Nikon Z6 III camera frame by frame.

This project leverages **TensorFlow.js** and **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking, enabling users to control the video playback simply by moving their hands—providing a touch-free, immersive experience.

## ✨ Features

* 🖐 **AI Gesture Control**: Uses the webcam to track hand movements. Move your hand left or right to scrub through the disassembly timeline.
* 🎞️ **Frame-by-Frame Inspection**: High-quality video frames extracted via FFmpeg ensure zero-latency scrubbing and precise control.
* 🚀 **Pure Frontend**: Runs entirely in the browser using static files (HTML/CSS/JS). No complex backend required.
* 📱 **Responsive**: Optimized for desktop browsers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **[MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)** - Real-time hand gesture recognition.
* **[TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)** - In-browser machine learning.
* **FFmpeg** - Video processing and frame extraction.
* **Python** - Local development server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x (To run the local server)

FFmpeg (If you need to process a new video file)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```Bash

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/nikon-z63-disassembly.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/nikon-z63-disassembly.git)
cd nikon-z63-disassembly
```

### 3. Process Video Frames (First Run Only)
If the frames/ directory is empty, you need to extract frames from the source video. Run the following command in your terminal:

```Bash

# Make sure FFmpeg is installed and added to your PATH
ffmpeg -i "Z63_Disassemble.mp4" frames/frame_%04d.jpg
```

### 4. Start Local Server
Due to browser security policies (CORS and Webcam permissions), this project must run on a server. Do not open index.html directly.

```Bash

python -m http.server 8000
```

### 5. Access the App
Open your browser (Chrome or Edge recommended) and navigate to:

http://localhost:8000

Grant permission for the browser to access your webcam to start the experience.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting & Remote Access
Why can't I open the camera on my phone or another computer?
Modern browsers enforce strict security policies. Webcam access is only allowed in "Secure Contexts" (HTTPS or localhost).

If you try to access the site via a standard local IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.5:8000), the browser will block the camera without prompting.

Solutions:

VS Code Port Forwarding (Recommended): Use the "Ports" tab in VS Code to forward port 8000 and set visibility to "Public". Use the generated HTTPS link.

Ngrok: Use ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local server:

```Bash

ngrok http 8000
```

Playback is laggy?
Ensure your extracted images in the frames/ folder are optimized. High-resolution images can cause loading delays.
